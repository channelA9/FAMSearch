They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their academic freedom or inquiry.""As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect each student's true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from them. They protect their academic freedom.""As colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. Professors do not discriminate against or harass colleagues. They respect and defend the free inquiry of associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas, professors show due respect for the opinions of others.

Professors accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution. As members of an academic institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars.

Professors give due regard to their paramount responsibilities within their institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, professors recognize the effect of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.""As members of their community, professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens. Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution.

Ethics in research and creative activities are addressed in the Policy on Upholding Research Integrity and Responding to the Allegations of Research Misconduct: https://www.csusb.edu/policies/administration-grants-and-contracts-support-sponsored-programs-policy""Professors, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed upon them. Their primary responsibility to their subject is to seek and to state the truth as they see it. To this end professors devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence. They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their academic freedom or inquiry.""As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect each student's true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from them. They protect their academic freedom.""As colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. Professors do not discriminate against or harass colleagues. They respect and defend the free inquiry of associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas, professors show due respect for the opinions of others. Professors acknowledge academic debt and strive to be objective in their professional judgment of colleagues. Professors accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution. As members of an academic institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars. Although professors observe the stated regulations of the institution, provided the regulations do not contravene academic freedom, they maintain their right to criticize and seek revision. Professors give due regard to their paramount responsibilities within their institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, professors recognize the effect of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.""As members of their community, professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens. Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution. When they speak or act as private persons they avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their college or university. As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, professors have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom.""In accounts of their own professional activities (FARs, AARs, applications for grants and leaves and the like), faculty members are held to the same standards of honesty as they are in their professional work itself.",0.3
"How would a faculty member conduct a faculty exchange?",directed,embedding_file,command-r-plus,500,"A faculty exchange may be arranged within the CSUC system, with another private or public institution of higher learning. Faculty exchanges are primarily for faculty who have been at an institution for an extended period of time and who would, therefore, most benefit by the renewal which may be gained from an exchange agreement. Exchanges are made for a period of one academic year.The following criteria will be applied in evaluating requests for faculty exchange. Only tenured faculty are eligible for faculty exchange, except in unusual circumstances. The faculty member's Department Chairman and College Dean must approve the exchange and certify that the absence of the faculty member will not curtail nor have a negative effect on the academic program. There must be a tangible demonstration of prospects for the professional growth of the faculty member or for other benefits for this institution.In order that there not be too great a disruption to a department's academic program, normally no more than 20% of the tenured faculty of any department may be on leave at any one time.The responsibility lies with the faculty member to initiate the exchange. Thus, a faculty member bears the burden of finding the exchanging faculty member. A faculty member should request approval for a proposed exchange in a written memo to his or her Department Chairman and College Dean, in which the particulars of the exchange are outlined. The exchanging faculty member coming to this campus must be acceptable to the gaining department here. Faculty exchanges are normally made by two faculty members in the same department or discipline. However, an exchange between faculty or differing disciplines is permissible if appropriate arrangements are made and if no staffing problems result. A faculty exchange should be arranged sufficiently early in the academic year to ensure that appropriate curricular and scheduling arrangements can be made.Normal faculty appointment procedures, such as the development of a dossier and an interview, are followed in all faculty exchanges. A written exchange agreement, developed by the Office of Academic Affairs, will be signed by all faculty involved in the exchange and by appropriate administrative officers of the institutions. Appropriate Faculty Benefits, such as accrual of time toward sabbatical leave or an earned merit salary increase will be specified in the exchange agreement. Arrangements for travel expenses, if the exchange is within the CSUC system and if the distance between campuses is greater than 100 miles, may be arranged through the Office of Academic Affairs. Upon completion of the exchange, the faculty member shall file a report with the Office of Academic Affairs detailing the experience gained during the exchange.",0.3

Summer Research Fellowships > c. Faculty Research Awards  The purpose of these grants is to facilitate faculty research, scholarship, and creative activity, ultimately leading to professional growth and enhancement of the student educational experience.   Mini-grants provide 'seed monies' for new projects or new phases of longer-term projects that show promise of attracting external funding. They can be used for support such as reassigned time, student assistants, clerical help, duplicating, computer time, supplies, services, equipment, and travel related to the project.   Summer Research Fellowships provide faculty financial support for a substantial project of creative activity, scholarship, or research. This could include completing a manuscript, specialized coursework or training, an exhibition, or a performance. Faculty members can apply for either a stipend or research expenses.   Faculty Research Awards provide reassigned time to develop or complete a substantial creative scholarship or research project. The department or school in which the faculty member resides will receive funding for two course reassigned times at the internal rate.   To apply for any of these grants, you must use the appropriate standardized format, which can be obtained from the Office of Academic Research. Only one application per grant category can be submitted by each faculty member or principal investigator. Applications are evaluated according to the quality of the proposal and feasibility of the project, among other criteria.   If you wish to apply for multiple awards, you must provide a clear justification. Awards are granted based on recommendations made by the Faculty Professional Development Coordinating Committee.",0.3

"What is the university stance on Academic Freedom?",directed,embedding_file,command-r,500,"Section 400.0: Resolved: Academic freedom is the indispensable quality of institutions of higher education.

"What are the ethical standards faculty should observe?",directed,embedding_file,command-r,500,"Professors, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed upon them. Their primary responsibility to their subject is to seek and to state the truth as they see it. To this end professors devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence. They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending, and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their academic freedom or inquiry.  As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect each student's true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from them. They protect their academic freedom.  As colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. Professors do not discriminate against or harass colleagues. They respect and defend the free inquiry of associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas, professors show due respect for the opinions of others. Professors acknowledge academic debt and strive to be objective in their professional judgment of colleagues. Professors accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution. As members of an academic institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars. Although professors observe the stated regulations of the institution, provided the regulations do not contravene academic freedom, they maintain their right to criticize and seek revision. Professors give due regard to their paramount responsibilities within their institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, professors recognize the effect of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.  As members of their community, professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens. Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution. When they speak or act as private persons they avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their college or university. As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, professors have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom.  In accounts of their own professional activities (FARs, AARs, applications for grants and leaves and the like), faculty members are held to the same standards of honesty as they are in their professional work itself.",0.3
