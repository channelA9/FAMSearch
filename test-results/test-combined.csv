They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their academic freedom or inquiry.""As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect each student's true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from them. They protect their academic freedom.""As colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. Professors do not discriminate against or harass colleagues. They respect and defend the free inquiry of associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas, professors show due respect for the opinions of others.

Professors accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution. As members of an academic institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars.

Professors give due regard to their paramount responsibilities within their institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, professors recognize the effect of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.""As members of their community, professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens. Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution.

Ethics in research and creative activities are addressed in the Policy on Upholding Research Integrity and Responding to the Allegations of Research Misconduct: https://www.csusb.edu/policies/administration-grants-and-contracts-support-sponsored-programs-policy""Professors, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed upon them. Their primary responsibility to their subject is to seek and to state the truth as they see it. To this end professors devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence. They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their academic freedom or inquiry.""As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect each student's true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from them. They protect their academic freedom.""As colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. Professors do not discriminate against or harass colleagues. They respect and defend the free inquiry of associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas, professors show due respect for the opinions of others. Professors acknowledge academic debt and strive to be objective in their professional judgment of colleagues. Professors accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution. As members of an academic institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars. Although professors observe the stated regulations of the institution, provided the regulations do not contravene academic freedom, they maintain their right to criticize and seek revision. Professors give due regard to their paramount responsibilities within their institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, professors recognize the effect of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.""As members of their community, professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens. Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution. When they speak or act as private persons they avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their college or university. As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, professors have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom.""In accounts of their own professional activities (FARs, AARs, applications for grants and leaves and the like), faculty members are held to the same standards of honesty as they are in their professional work itself.",0.3
"How would a faculty member conduct a faculty exchange?",directed,embedding_file,command-r-plus,500,"A faculty exchange may be arranged within the CSUC system, with another private or public institution of higher learning. Faculty exchanges are primarily for faculty who have been at an institution for an extended period of time and who would, therefore, most benefit by the renewal which may be gained from an exchange agreement. Exchanges are made for a period of one academic year.The following criteria will be applied in evaluating requests for faculty exchange. Only tenured faculty are eligible for faculty exchange, except in unusual circumstances. The faculty member's Department Chairman and College Dean must approve the exchange and certify that the absence of the faculty member will not curtail nor have a negative effect on the academic program. There must be a tangible demonstration of prospects for the professional growth of the faculty member or for other benefits for this institution.In order that there not be too great a disruption to a department's academic program, normally no more than 20% of the tenured faculty of any department may be on leave at any one time.The responsibility lies with the faculty member to initiate the exchange. Thus, a faculty member bears the burden of finding the exchanging faculty member. A faculty member should request approval for a proposed exchange in a written memo to his or her Department Chairman and College Dean, in which the particulars of the exchange are outlined. The exchanging faculty member coming to this campus must be acceptable to the gaining department here. Faculty exchanges are normally made by two faculty members in the same department or discipline. However, an exchange between faculty or differing disciplines is permissible if appropriate arrangements are made and if no staffing problems result. A faculty exchange should be arranged sufficiently early in the academic year to ensure that appropriate curricular and scheduling arrangements can be made.Normal faculty appointment procedures, such as the development of a dossier and an interview, are followed in all faculty exchanges. A written exchange agreement, developed by the Office of Academic Affairs, will be signed by all faculty involved in the exchange and by appropriate administrative officers of the institutions. Appropriate Faculty Benefits, such as accrual of time toward sabbatical leave or an earned merit salary increase will be specified in the exchange agreement. Arrangements for travel expenses, if the exchange is within the CSUC system and if the distance between campuses is greater than 100 miles, may be arranged through the Office of Academic Affairs. Upon completion of the exchange, the faculty member shall file a report with the Office of Academic Affairs detailing the experience gained during the exchange.",0.3

Faculty Research Awards  The purpose of these grants is to facilitate faculty research, scholarship, and creative activity, ultimately leading to professional growth and enhancement of the student educational experience.   Mini-grants provide 'seed monies' for new projects or new phases of longer-term projects that show promise of attracting external funding. They can be used for support such as reassigned time, student assistants, clerical help, duplicating, computer time, supplies, services, equipment, and travel related to the project.   Summer Research Fellowships provide faculty financial support for a substantial project of creative activity, scholarship, or research. This could include completing a manuscript, specialized coursework or training, an exhibition, or a performance. Faculty members can apply for either a stipend or research expenses.   Faculty Research Awards provide reassigned time to develop or complete a substantial creative scholarship or research project. The department or school in which the faculty member resides will receive funding for two course reassigned times at the internal rate.   To apply for any of these grants, you must use the appropriate standardized format, which can be obtained from the Office of Academic Research. Only one application per grant category can be submitted by each faculty member or principal investigator. Applications are evaluated according to the quality of the proposal and feasibility of the project, among other criteria.   If you wish to apply for multiple awards, you must provide a clear justification. Awards are granted based on recommendations made by the Faculty Professional Development Coordinating Committee.",0.3

"What are the ethical standards faculty should observe?",directed,embedding_file,command-r,500,"Professors, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed upon them. Their primary responsibility to their subject is to seek and to state the truth as they see it. To this end professors devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence. They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending, and transmitting knowledge. They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests, these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their academic freedom or inquiry.  As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect each student's true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from them. They protect their academic freedom.  As colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the community of scholars. Professors do not discriminate against or harass colleagues. They respect and defend the free inquiry of associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas, professors show due respect for the opinions of others. Professors acknowledge academic debt and strive to be objective in their professional judgment of colleagues. Professors accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution. As members of an academic institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and scholars. Although professors observe the stated regulations of the institution, provided the regulations do not contravene academic freedom, they maintain their right to criticize and seek revision. Professors give due regard to their paramount responsibilities within their institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. When considering the interruption or termination of their service, professors recognize the effect of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.  As members of their community, professors have the rights and obligations of other citizens. Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their responsibilities to their subject, to their students, to their profession, and to their institution. When they speak or act as private persons they avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their college or university. As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, professors have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom.  In accounts of their own professional activities (FARs, AARs, applications for grants and leaves and the like), faculty members are held to the same standards of honesty as they are in their professional work itself.",0.3

Here�s a step-by-step guide based on the relevant regulations:  1. **Eligibility**: Ensure you meet the eligibility criteria. Generally, only tenured faculty are eligible for faculty exchange, except in unusual circumstances. Faculty exchanges are primarily intended for faculty who have been at an institution for an extended period and would benefit from renewal through an exchange agreement.  2. **Initiate the Exchange**: The responsibility to initiate the exchange lies with the faculty member. You must identify a faculty member from another institution (within the CSUC system, or another private or public institution) who is willing to exchange positions with you.  3. **Department and College Approval**: Obtain approval from your Department Chairman and College Dean. They need to certify that your absence will not negatively impact the academic program and that there are tangible prospects for your professional growth or other benefits for the institution.  4. **Compliance with Leave Proportions**: Ensure that no more than 20% of the tenured faculty in your department are on leave at any one time to avoid disrupting the department's academic program.  5. **Written Proposal**: Submit a written memo to your Department Chairman and College Dean, outlining the particulars of the proposed exchange. This document should demonstrate the potential for professional growth and other benefits for your institution.  6. **Acceptability of Exchanging Faculty**: Ensure that the faculty member coming to your campus is acceptable to the gaining department. Normally, exchanges are made between faculty members in the same department or discipline, but exchanges between different disciplines are permissible if no staffing problems result.  7. **Timing**: Arrange the faculty exchange early enough in the academic year to allow for appropriate curricular and scheduling arrangements.  8. **Faculty Appointment Procedures**: Follow normal faculty appointment procedures, including the development of a dossier and an interview.  9. **Exchange Agreement**: A written exchange agreement will be developed by the Office of Academic Affairs. This agreement will be signed by all faculty involved in the exchange and by appropriate administrative officers of the institutions. It will also specify appropriate faculty benefits such as accrual of time toward sabbatical leave or an earned merit salary increase.  10. **Travel Arrangements**: If the exchange is within the CSUC system and the distance between campuses is greater than 100 miles, arrangements for travel expenses may be made through the Office of Academic Affairs.  11",0.3
"To what extent can faculty organize and bargain?",loose,embedding_file,gpt-4o,500,"Faculty members within the California State University (CSU) system, including those at California State University and Colleges (CSUC), have the opportunity to organize and engage in collective bargaining, as provided by the California Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA). This act, enacted into law on September 13, 1978, by Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., is codified in the Education Code Section 3560, et seq.  HEERA grants faculty members the right to determine if they wish to be represented by an exclusive agent in negotiations concerning ""wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment"" (HEERA, Section 3561, r.). Importantly, the legislation also aims to preserve traditional shared governance mechanisms, including consultation and the principle of peer review in faculty personnel decisions. The act explicitly states that joint decision-making and consultation between administration and faculty is a long-accepted governance method in higher education and essential for fulfilling the educational missions of these institutions (HEERA, Section 3561 b.).  However, while faculty have the right to engage in collective bargaining, the Academic Senate of the CSUC, as a formal policy-recommending body, does not participate in the process of collective bargaining. The Academic Senate focuses on educational and professional matters, ensuring they do not become subjects of bargaining. It continues to serve as the official voice of faculties in systemwide academic and professional matters, maintaining responsibilities related to academic policies, standards, and governance, separate from collective bargaining issues.  In summary, faculty within the CSU system can organize and bargain collectively on employment-related matters, while the Academic Senate plays a key role in academic governance and policymaking, distinct from the bargaining process.",0.3

This means faculty involvement is preserved in various academic and professional matters, even within the collective bargaining context.  3. **Role of the Academic Senate**: The Academic Senate serves as the official voice of the faculties in systemwide academic and professional matters. While the Academic Senate is involved in policy and governance issues, it does not participate in collective bargaining processes. Matters related to wages, hours, and conditions of employment are generally excluded from the Academic Senate's purview (FAM Section 402.0, III).  4. **Peer Review Principles**: The principle of peer review regarding appointment, promotion, retention, and tenure of academic employees is preserved under HEERA. This highlights the faculty's role in maintaining academic standards and integrity through collaborative governance structures.  5. **Limitations on Bargaining**: The Academic Senate shall not engage in collective bargaining, reinforcing the delineation of responsibilities where certain matters are reserved for faculty unions or exclusive representatives. This separation ensures that educational and professional matters do not become subjects of bargaining.  In summary, faculty can organize and bargain collectively under the framework provided by HEERA, allowing them to negotiate employment conditions while also participating in shared governance. The Academic Senate plays a significant role in academic matters but is distinct from the collective bargaining process, which is typically handled by designated faculty representatives or unions.",0.3

"What is the university stance on Academic Freedom?",loose,embedding_file,claude-3-5-sonnet-latest,500,"Based on the provided FAM sections, the university's stance on Academic Freedom is that it is considered an ""indispensable quality of institutions of higher education."" This is explicitly stated in Section 400.0 which affirms that academic freedom is essential for pursuing and sharing truth for the common good, rather than serving individual or institutional interests.  The university adopts the AAUP's core principles on academic freedom, which have been developed over 90+ years and are viewed as the authoritative standard in higher education. This commitment to academic freedom is reinforced in other sections, such as:  1. FAM 355.6 on Professional Ethics emphasizes that professors have a responsibility to ""seek and state the truth as they see it"" and must maintain academic freedom of inquiry, even while pursuing other interests.  2. Professors are expected to protect students' academic freedom and ""encourage the free pursuit of learning.""  3. Faculty members have the right to ""respect and defend the free inquiry of associates"" and maintain their right to criticize and seek revision of institutional regulations that don't contravene academic freedom.  4. As citizens and academics, professors have a ""particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and further public understanding of academic freedom.""  So in summary, CSUSB views academic freedom as: - A fundamental and indispensable right - Essential for pursuing truth and knowledge - Something that must be actively protected and promoted - Applicable to both teaching and research activities - Part of faculty's professional ethical obligations - Subject to professional standards but not to be compromised by other interests  The university's strong institutional commitment to academic freedom aligns with established AAUP principles and recognizes it as crucial for fulfilling higher education's mission of advancing knowledge for the common good.",0.3

Legal Framework: - The California Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) provides faculty members the right to be represented by an exclusive agent in negotiations regarding ""wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment""  2. Preservation of Shared Governance: - HEERA specifically preserves traditional shared governance mechanisms under collective bargaining, including:   - Consultation between administration and faculty   - Principle of peer review in faculty personnel decisions   - Functions of the Academic Senate and faculty councils   - Academic and professional matters affecting the university  3. Academic Senate Role: - Serves as the official voice of faculty in systemwide academic and professional matters - Cannot participate directly in the collective bargaining process - Focuses on educational and professional matters rather than bargaining issues  4. Limitations: - The Academic Senate shall not participate in collective bargaining processes - Matters affecting wages, hours of employment, and other terms/conditions of employment are typically handled through collective bargaining rather than Senate processes - The Senate works to ensure educational and professional matters do not become subjects of bargaining  5. Protected Rights: - Joint decision-making between administration and faculty is preserved - Peer review processes for appointment, promotion, retention and tenure are maintained - Faculty retain right to participate in shared governance through Academic Senate  In summary, faculty have the right to organize and engage in collective bargaining through their exclusive representative for employment-related matters, while maintaining separate shared governance rights through the Academic Senate system for academic and professional matters.

"An ancillary unit has disbanded. What are the administrative steps to take?",loose,embedding_sentence,gemini-1.5-flash,500,"Based on Section 105.4 of the Faculty Administration Manual (FAM), when an ancillary unit disbands (which is considered a form of termination), the following administrative steps must be taken:  1. **Transfer of Assets:**  All residual funds and property become the custody of the academic unit or administrative division under which the Ancillary Unit was housed (Section 105.4).  These assets must be used for similar programs/activities that advance the mission of the campus.  2. **Formal Termination Process:** While the question states the unit has *disbanded*, the FAM indicates a formal termination process is required if the unit has been inactive for 12 months or for other compelling reasons (Section 105.4).  This involves a determination by the Faculty Senate and the Provost/VPAA.  Even if the unit disbanded informally, a formal termination process should be followed to ensure proper closure.  3. **Reporting and Recommendation:**  A report on the termination must be submitted to the Provost/VPAA (or designee), who will review it and make a recommendation on the unit's status (Section 105.4). This report and recommendation are then forwarded to the President by May 15th for a final decision.   In short, the process involves not only the transfer of assets but also a formal declaration of termination by the appropriate bodies, ensuring compliance with university policies and procedures.
