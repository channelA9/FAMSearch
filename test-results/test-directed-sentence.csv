"How would a faculty member conduct a faculty exchange?",directed,embedding_sentence,command-r,500,"> Faculty exchanges are normally made by two faculty members in the same department or discipline. A faculty exchange should be arranged sufficiently early in the academic year to ensure that appropriate curricular and scheduling arrangements can be made. Normal faculty appointment procedures, such as the development of a dossier and an interview, are followed in all faculty exchanges.  > Faculty exchanges are primarily for faculty who have been at an institution for an extended period of time and who would, therefore, most benefit by the renewal which may be gained from an exchange agreement. Thus, a faculty member bears the burden of finding the exchanging faculty member. Exchanges are made for a period of one academic year.  > The following criteria will be applied in evaluating requests for faculty exchange: There must be a tangible demonstration of prospects for the professional growth of the faculty member or for other benefits for this institution. In order that there not be too great a disruption to a department's academic program, normally no more than 20% of the tenured faculty of any department may be on leave at any one time.  > The responsibility lies with the faculty member to initiate the exchange. The faculty member should request approval for a proposed exchange in a written memo to his or her Department Chairman and College Dean, in which the particulars of the exchange are outlined. The faculty member's Department Chairman and College Dean must approve the exchange and certify that the absence of the faculty member will not curtail nor have a negative effect on the academic program. The exchanging faculty member coming to this campus must be acceptable to the gaining department here.  > Upon completion of the exchange, the faculty member shall file a report with the Office of Academic Affairs detailing the experience gained during the exchange. Only tenured faculty are eligible for faculty exchange, except in unusual circumstances. A written exchange agreement, developed by the Office of Academic Affairs, will be signed by all faculty involved in the exchange and by appropriate administrative officers of the institutions.  > However, an exchange between faculty or differing disciplines is permissible if appropriate arrangements are made and if no staffing problems result. Appropriate Faculty Benefits, such as accrual of time toward sabbatical leave or an earned merit salary increase will be specified in the exchange agreement.",0.5
