The faculty member then needs to submit a written memo to their Department Chairman and College Dean outlining the exchange particulars.  This memo must demonstrate tangible prospects for professional growth or other benefits to the institution.  The proposal must be submitted early in the academic year to allow for curricular and scheduling adjustments.  The proposal must also show that the exchange won't negatively impact the department's academic program; no more than 20% of tenured faculty can be on leave simultaneously.  Both the Department Chairman and College Dean must approve the exchange, certifying that the faculty member's absence won't negatively affect the academic program, and the incoming faculty member must be acceptable to the department.
