Resolved: Academic freedom is the indispensable quality of institutions of higher
education. As the AAUP's core policy statement argues, "institutions of higher education
are conducted for the common good and not to further the interest of either the individual
teacher or the institution as a whole. The common good depends upon the free search for
truth and its free exposition" (1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and
Tenure).
For more than ninety years the AAUP has been engaged in developing standards for
protecting academic freedom and in working for the acceptance of these standards by the
community of higher education. The Association has long been viewed as the authoritative
voice of the academic profession in this regard. Statements, reports, and policies dealing
with academic freedom, as well as with other key issues, are published in the
AAUP's Policy Documents and Reports, also known as the "Redbook."
