appealed, the materials may be discarded. Otherwise, these must be saved as evidence until the
appeal has been settled by the procedures outlined below (Section J).
The procedure for determining the results of the election shall be as follows:
(1) If the vote is for a single candidate:
(a) If any candidate is the first choice on a majority of ballots, that candidate is declared elected. If
there is no first-choice majority candidate,
(b) the candidate with the smallest number of first choice votes is eliminated, and the ballots on which
that candidate was the first choice are distributed, according to the voters&#39; second choices, among the
candidates remaining. If there is now a majority for one candidate, that person is declared elected.
Otherwise,
(c) the candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and those ballots redistributed according to the voters&#39;
highest remaining choices.
This process is continued until a majority for one candidate is obtained, at which point that candidate is
declared elected.
(d) If it becomes necessary to eliminate a candidate, and there is a tie as to who has the fewest votes,
a random choice procedure will be used to determine which candidate is eliminated prior to the next
count. The same procedure shall be used for any and all ties that may occur when determining the
results.
(2) If the vote is to elect two or more candidates:
One candidate will be elected as in Part (1). Subsequent candidates will be elected as follows:
(a) the ballots will be distributed according to the voters&#39; first choices.
(b) Those ballots whose first-choice votes are for the candidate that has already been elected are
redistributed among the remaining candidates according to the voters&#39; second choices.
If at this stage any candidate has a majority of the votes, he or she is declared elected. If not, the
candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their ballots redistributed according to the voters&#39;
highest remaining choices.
(c) The redistribution process is continued, as in the election of a single candidate, until a majority for

one candidate is obtained, at which point that candidate is declared elected.
(d) Ties are dealt with as in part (a) above.
(e) The process is repeated until the desired number of candidates are elected.
(f) In elections for members of the Faculty Senate, the alternate shall be elected after Senators
are elected.
(3) Invalid Ballots: Ballots shall be invalidated and set aside for any of the following reasons:
(a) failure to authenticate the voter as part of a constituency;
(b) two or more ballots submitted from the same voter;
(c) illegible or indeterminable preferences on ballot.

As soon as the ballots have been tallied, the Elections Committee/Officer shall make the results of the
election known to the Faculty.

concerning implementation or interpretation of Article II of these bylaws of the Constitution, they shall

this decision to the Executive Committee whose rulings shall be final.

The announced results of any campus-wide or college/constituent unit election may be appealed within
the first eight (8) academic days after said results are announced. Appeal shall be by petition, signed
by ten (10) faculty members or five (5) in the case of college/constituent unit elections, and delivered to
the Elections Committee/Officer or the Senate support staff as appropriate. The appeal shall state the
grounds for questioning the announced election results.
The merits of any appeal for university-wide or college/constituent unit elections shall be judged as
soon as possible by an Election Appeal Board consisting of the Executive Committee of the Faculty
Senate. The Election Appeal Board may subpoena relevant materials and take testimony as it sees fit.
The proceedings of the Election Appeal Board shall be open only to members of the Board itself, the
Senate support staff, and those whom the Board calls for testimony.
Based on its findings, the Appeal Board may:
