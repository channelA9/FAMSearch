105.4,"Purpose and Scope
1

Ancillary Units (such as Institutes and Centers) have become the principal instruments by which
a university community can organize particular areas of research, curricular programs, and
service to the community which transcend the boundaries of traditional academic departments
or disciplines. They are characterized by their flexible goals and structure, specific functions,
and are multidisciplinary in nature. Ancillary Units can provide a valuable link among separate
but related academic disciplines and between the academic expertise of the University and the
needs of the surrounding community. All Ancillary Units must contribute to the academic and
strategic mission of California State University San Bernardino (CSUSB). The academic mission
of the University includes instruction, research, and service, including community partnership
and other such enterprises.
Definitions
1. Ancillary Unit: For the purpose of this policy, the term ""Ancillary Units"" shall be
taken to include centers, institutes, bureaus, laboratories, research groups,
councils, consortia, or similar entities that support the academic missions of the
University. It does not apply to other types of entities that may have similar titles
(e.g., the Student Health Center, the Learning Center) but that either support the
nonacademic functions of the University or are housed and funded by the

University administration. This policy applies to all Ancillary Units currently
established as well as those that may be developed in the future.
2. Functions of Ancillary Units may include, but are not limited to:
a. conducting opinion polls and focus groups
b. conducting basic research
c. data gathering
d. developing policy studies and analyses
e. disseminating research findings
f. forming a group for submission of grants proposal{s) for support of professional
activities
g. providing a link between the University and outside organizations
h. sponsoring conferences
i. sponsoring, coordinating, and promoting the research of faculty and students from
several departments or colleges.
j. submitting grant/contract proposals, and conducting funded sponsored programs
activity.

3. Ancillary Units shall not offer courses for University credit; however, courses may
be offered in conjunction with a department or college.
4. All Ancillary Units must be reviewed by the Faculty Senate and Provost/Vice
President of Academic Affairs {VPAA) or designee, and be approved by the
President. Once approved, these units have the right to seek outside funding as
university entities.
5. Ancillary Units Status: Ancillary Units are to be classified internally based upon
the stage of development and/or adherence to reporting requirements set forth
in this policy.
a. Developmental Status: An Ancillary Unit with ""developmental"" status is a
new unit which will be reviewed at the end of the third year of operation.
This ""developmental"" status label is to be used only for CSUSB internal
purposes, and under most circumstances should not be used in
applications for external funding. After a successful third-year review, the
Ancillary Unit will be granted ""active"" status. The Ancillary Unit may
formally request another cycle of developmental status if it requires
additional time. An Ancillary Unit with ""developmental"" status submits an
annual report to the Unit's reporting person {see section 6) and to the
Faculty Senate.
b. Active Status: An Ancillary Unit with ""active"" status has undergone a
successful review at the end of its third year and submits an annual report
to the Unit's reporting person and to Faculty Senate. Once granted
""active"" status, the Ancillary Unit may be asked to undergo further review
if deemed necessary by the Unit's Reporting Person or by the
Provost/VPAA.

2

c. Probationary Status: An Ancillary Unit that fails to submit an annual
report to the reporting person (see below) or that fails to provide written
responses to the CCl's recommendations within 30 days will be considered
to be on ""probationary"" status. The reporting person or CCI shall notify
the Unit, the designee of the Provost/VPAA, and the Faculty Senate Office,
and the Unit will be given 60 days after notification to submit an annual
report or its written responses to the CCl's recommendations. Failure to
submit the annual report within this time will lead to placement of the
Ancillary Unit on ""inactive"" status.
d. Inactive Status: An ""inactive"" Unit may not seek funding or function as an
Ancillary Unit until it has undergone a successful review and has been
reinstated by the Provost/VPAA. To regain ""active"" status, the Unit must
submit required documents (see section 17) and a written request for
reinstatement to the Unit's reporting person, who will forward the
documents along with his/her comments to the Faculty Senate and
Provost/VPAA. The CCI will review the request and forward its
recommendation for reinstatement to the Faculty Senate Executive
Committee, which will provide its recommendation to the Unit's reporting
person and the Provost/VPAA.
e. Termination: An Ancillary unit may be terminated if it remains on
""inactive"" status for 12 months or for other compelling reasons, as
determined by the Faculty Senate and the Provost/VPAA.

6. Reporting Person: The ""reporting person"" is the head of the academic unit or
administrative division of the University (e.g., department, college, Office of
Graduate Studies, Office of Academic Affairs) who has programmatic oversight of
the Ancillary Unit.
7. Director: The ""Director"" shall be the person or persons who are responsible and
accountable for the activities of the Unit. The ""Director"" may be a single director,
multiple co-directors, an executive director, or a committee with at least one
person who is identified as ""responsible"" for the governance of the Ancillary Unit.
8. Annual Report: The ""annual report"" is the report that the Ancillary Unit shall
make each year to the reporting person. The annual report will include
information regarding the Ancillary Unit's goals and accomplishments, the
participation of students and faculty in the Unit's activities, the Unit's governance
and reporting structure, the amount of external funds raised, units of assigned
time, and the use of the University's internal resources.
9. Committee for Centers and Institutes (CCI): The CCI shall be established as a
special committee of the Faculty Senate that is composed of one tenure-track
faculty member from each college, one student representative, and two current
directors of centers or institutes. The committee shall also include as an ex
officio, non-voting member the Associate Provost for Academic Research. The CCI

3

is responsible for conducting administration and oversight of the procedures
established in this policy, including:
a. review proposals for the creation of centers and institutes and refer the proposals to
the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate for action;
b. review annual reports and conduct periodic reviews for centers and institutes and
make recommendations on their status to the Faculty Senate, Provost, and President
c. complete annual updates on the center and institute automated system, including
inputting current contact information for Cl directors and reporting persons;
d. conduct administration and oversight of the completion, submission, tracking, and
storage of center and institute proposals, annual reports, and the procedures for
periodic review;
e. coordinate support and, where appropriate, foster collaboration among centers and
institutes across campus;
f. provide the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate a report, prepared by the CCI
committee chair, at the end of each semester that includes the status of all Cl annual
reports and a summary of other committee activities related to the duties described
above.

Policy Statement
10. Every Ancillary Unit must be under the programmatic oversight of an academic unit or
administrative division of the University (e.g. department, college, Office of Graduate
Studies, or Office of Academic Affairs} pursuant to Executive Order No. 751, which is
available at http://www.calstate.edu/EO/E0-751.pdf.
11. The Ancillary Unit may choose the leadership structure which best suits the mission of
the Unit, as long as it clearly delineates who is responsible and accountable for activities
of the Unit. The responsible person-referred to as the ""Director""-should be the most
qualified person/people for the role, where ""qualified person"" is operationally defined
to mean a person, who has the technical and managerial expertise to assume the role,
as well as the capacity to operate in an academic environment. Under most
circumstances, the Director should be a tenure-track faculty member.
12. Ancillary Units with ""developmental"" status should consider including an Advisory Board
composed of tenure-track faculty, the Director and where useful, an appropriate
number of community members. Ancillary Units without a faculty director must have an
advisory board with at least two faculty representatives appointed by the Executive
Committee of the Faculty Senate. The members of the Advisory Board shall be approved
by the Unit's reporting person, (e.g. College Dean, Provost/VPAA}. Existing Active
Ancillary Units may also wish to include an Advisory Board.

4

13. While it is expected that most Ancillary Units will eventually generate enough external
funding to become self-sufficient, the University may provide some initial support in the
form of assigned time, office space, equipment, staff support, etc.
14. Once an Ancillary Unit is approved as ""developmental"" or ""active"" status, the Unit may
seek funding from outside entities. All formal agreements or contracts must be signed
by the Executive Director of the University Enterprise Corporation for CSU SB (UEC} or
his/her designee, or the President or his/her designee. See the Policy for the
Administration of Grants and Contracts in Support of Sponsored Program, which is
available at http://policies.csusb.edu/grants_and contracts.htm.
15. All Active Ancillary Units shall be listed in the Campus Directory along with the name(s)
and phone number(s) of the Director, staff, and the address of the office where the
Ancillary Unit is primarily housed.
16. Normally, Ancillary Unit programs and activities fall under campus ownership, including
component activities and program funds, and therefore must follow campus policies
and procedures. In case of externally funded grant and contract activity, policies and
procedures negotiated by the UEC/Sponsored Programs and the external funding
agency must be followed.

Procedure and Process
APPROVAL PROCESS FOR INSTITUTES:
17. Proposals for the formation of an Ancillary Unit shall employ the following procedures:

to contribute to the accomplishment of the stated purpose and to the academic and
strategic mission of the University.
b. A clear statement of how the Ancillary Unit will be housed within an academic or
administrative division of the University (e.g. department, college, Office of
Graduate Studies, or Office of Academic Affairs) and description of:
i. the proposed organizational and governance structure (including an
organizational chart and signature of all individuals involved in the
Ancillary Unit); and
ii. a clear statement of who is responsible for reporting the Unit's activities
(e.g. Provost/VPAA or designee, Associate Provost of Research, College

research, etc.
h. A statement of all possible sources of anticipated funding (internal and external).
i. A projected budget for the first three years of operation with revenues and
expenditures, including funding requirements from University sources (Note:
Approval of the Ancillary Unit does not mean that the Unit will receive funding from
the University). The budget report should follow the format established by the CCI
(Appendix A).
18. A proposal for an Ancillary Unit shall be submitted to the Faculty Senate Executive
Committee, which will refer it to the CCI and other appropriate committees (e.g., the
General Education Committee, the University Curriculum Committee, the Faculty Affairs
Committee, or other committees of the Faculty Senate) for review. These committees
shall forward their comments and recommendations, including any concerns and
suggested changes for the original proposal, to the Executive Committee of the Faculty
Senate. The proposal along with the recommendations from the CCI and any other
committee(s) that reviewed the proposal shall be placed on the Faculty Senate agenda
as an action item. Additionally, prior to the Faculty Senate meeting, the Executive
Committee of the Faculty Senate shall send an email announcing its agenda containing
the name of the Ancillary Unit. Comments or concerns regarding the proposed Ancillary
Unit may be made to a senator prior to the Faculty Senate meeting for which this
Ancillary Unit's approval is an information item. Full copies of the original proposals will
be made available in the Faculty Senate Office.
19. The Provost/VPAA (or designee) will make recommendation(s) to the President
regarding approval of the proposal. If the proposal is approved and signed by the
President, copies of the final proposal will be filed in the Unit's reporting person, Office
of the Provost/VPAA, and in the Faculty Senate Office. The newly approved Ancillary
Unit shall have ""developmental"" status and be subject to review at the end of its third

6

full academic year of operation (see section 5). The Office of the Provost/VPAA will
maintain a list of Ancillary Units, including contact information for Director(s) of the
Unit.
20. If the President does not approve the Ancillary Unit proposal, his/her written comments
and recommendations will be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Faculty
Senate and a copy will be sent by the Office of the Faculty Senate to the originator(s) of
the proposal. The President's written comments and recommendations will also be
included on the Faculty Senate agenda as an information item.
21. Upon approval, the Ancillary Unit may seek funding from the University and from
external sources. The approval of the Ancillary Unit does not mean that the requested
university resources will be provided. The decision for university resources will be made
by the President or Provost/VPAA or designee.
ANNUAL REPORTS:
22. By October 1st of each year, the CCI will initiate the procedures for the submission of
annual reports and the completion of periodic reviews. The CCI will send fillable
electronic forms (using Adobe Sign or another electronic platform) to the Units'
directors which will be used for the submission of annual reports. The CCI is responsible
for updating its record of Units' directors and contact information prior to initiating the
procedures. The CCI shall forward its updated record of contact information for centers
and institutes to the Associate Provost for Academic Research who is responsible for
submitting it to the Chancellor's Office.
23. By October 30th of each year, each Ancillary Unit will submit an annual report of
activities for the previous academic year using the electronic form sent by the CCI. The
CCI is responsible for routing each annual report to the Unit's reporting person and
Provost/VPAA. The Unit's reporting person will submit their recommendations by
December 15 using the electronic form. The Unit's reporting person will include with
their recommendation the method used for the review (e.g., what elements were
evaluated, including budget and accomplishments; and what discussions were held).
The CCI is responsible for routing the reporting person's recommendations to the Units'
directors.
24. The Ancillary Unit may submit attachments with their annual report where applicable.
ANCILLARY UNIT REVIEW PROCESS:
25. The CCI will review each Ancillary Unit once every five years. If at the conclusion of the
review there are one or more unsatisfactory outcomes, the next review may be

7

scheduled in fewer than five years. In addition, the Unit's reporting person, the
Provost/VPAA, or the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate may initiate the review
process for an Ancillary Unit.
26. For the CCl's periodic review of the Ancillary Unit, the CCI shall obtain from the Faculty
Senate office an original or revised proposal for the Ancillary Unit. The CCI shall also
obtain copies of the annual reports since the last review of the Ancillary Unit, which the
CCI is responsible for storing on a University approved cloud (Microsoft Sharepoint or
another online cloud service);
For the Ancillary Unit's periodic review, the Unit's Director(s) will provide a short cover memo
that explains the contents and highlights of these annual reports
27. The CCI will review the material provided by the Ancillary Units, recommend a status for
them (from section 5 above), and indicate problems if they exist. The CCI will evaluate
the Unit using the following criteria:
a. the success of the Ancillary Unit in meeting the goals and objectives outlined in the
original approved proposal;
b. the effective use of all internal University support;
c. the success of obtaining external support and the use of that support;
28. The report of the CCI shall be submitted, as completed, to the Provost, Unit Reporting
Person, relevant College Dean, Director(s), Sponsored Programs, Executive Committee,
and President by March 30th. The report will include the evaluation criteria and
methods used to review the Unit. Within 30 days of receiving the CCl's report, Ancillary
Units may respond in writing to any recommendations made by the CCI. The Unit's
written response shall be attached to the Unit's annual report, included in the formal
record of the review, and forwarded to the Provost/VPAA.
29. The Senate shall receive the reports as information items. The Provost/VPAA (or
designee) shall review the report and make recommendations on the status of the
Ancillary Unit as ""continuing developmental (to be reviewed in 3 years),"" ""active,""
""inactive,"" ""probationary,"" or ""termination."" The report and recommendation(s) will be
forwarded to the President by May 15th, who shall make the final decision.
30. Upon discontinuance or termination of an Ancillary Unit, all residual funds and property
become custody of the academic unit or administrative division of the Reporting Person
and shall be used for similar programs/activities that advance the mission of the
campus.","[-0.03048223815858364, -0.01091605331748724, -0.0230038370937109, 0.023796478286385536, 0.011312373913824558, -0.00538048567250371, -0.0256919264793396, 0.03601349890232086,

107.3,"A. Faculty Position Funding Process
1. Faculty Serialized Positions
(a) All currently filled faculty positions will be transferred to each college by
the end of the 1997/98 fiscal year.
(b) Unfilled positions will be transferred to colleges, effective July 1, 1998
based on the 1997/98 faculty line allocations. Unfilled positions will be
serialized and funded at the Assistant Professor Step 1 level, using the
1998 faculty salary schedule. Corresponding benefits will be
maintained centrally by Academic Affairs since these new faculty lines
are going to be funded by converting current part-time faculty funds to
serialized faculty positions. Whenever colleges fill a vacant serialized
position, Academic Affairs will fund the 30% benefit cost.
2. New Tenure-Track Faculty Appointments
(a) Starting with the 1998/99 Academic Year, each college will be
responsible for budgeting and assigning a serial position to newly hired
(tenure track 2360 class code or full-time lecturer 2358 class code)
faculty.
(b) Colleges will also have the responsibility for converting all vacant
faculty serial positions used to support part-time faculty personnel to
the 911 part-time faculty blanket for the Academic Year. A position
transfer form will need to be sent to the Budget Office so that funds can
be transferred to the part-time faculty blanket.
3. New Temporary Full-Time Appointments
Colleges will budget and monitor all new temporary full-time faculty appointments. Such
appointments may be made by filling an existing serialized position.
4. Part-Time Faculty Appointments
2
Colleges will budget and monitor all temporary part-time faculty appointments using
funds from a serialized position..
(a) Conversion of Serialized Positions Colleges, after careful consideration,
may convert a vacant faculty serial position to support other needs in the
College. This may be done on a one-time basis or on a permanent basis. If
a faculty serial position is converted on a permanent basis, the college will
still need to meet their FTES within their allocated faculty lines. All
permanent conversions from faculty positions will have to have the approval
of the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Provost.
5. Faculty Leaves
(a) Leave-without-Pay (LWOP)
Colleges will receive full funding at the faculty member's rank and step for
the length of time the faculty member is on LWOP.
(b) Difference -in-Pay Leave (DIP)
Colleges will receive the equivalent salary of an Instructor step 1. The
faculty member receives the difference between an Instructor step 1 and
their current rank and step.
(c) Sabbatical
(1) Faculty on one term of sabbatical leave receive their full pay and
benefits.
(2) Faculty on two quarters leave receive 3/4 of their pay; colleges
receive 1/4 of the faculty member's rank and step.
(3) Faculty on sabbatical for the academic year receive 50% of their
pay; colleges receive the other 50% of the faculty member's salary
at the faculty member's rank and step.
Because sabbatical leaves are not funded by the Chancellor's Office or Academic
Affairs, each college should consider establishing a separate fund to wholly or partially
support sabbatical leave.
B. Staff Position Funding Process
1. Staff Serialized Positions
(a) Staff serialized positions will be transferred to the college/unit during the
1997-98 spring quarter. These positions are permanent positions allocated
to each college/unit and are part of the staff personnel baseline. The
college/unit will receive unused funds remaining in all vacant positions
3
during the 1997-98 fiscal year. Funds returned to the college/unit can be
transferred to any line item including supplies and services or equipment.
(b) During the 1998-99 fiscal year and thereafter, if a staff serialized
position becomes vacant the college unit has the flexibility to do the
following:
(1) The position can be recruited at the same classification and at the
position's funded salary or
(2) The position can be changed to another classification (with Human
Resources' review of the job description) to support the goals of
the college/unit. If the reclassification requires additional funds the
college/unit will need to cover the difference from their operating
expense budget. The University will cover the benefits up to the
monetary level of the prior benefits. If additional benefits are
needed for the position the college/unit will have to cover the cost
or
(3) The position can be downgraded. Unused funds returned to the
college/unit or
(4) The position can be eliminated with the funds (including benefits)
returned to the college/unit.
2. New Serialized Staff Positions
New staff positions requested by the college/unit will require the review of Human
Resources for the appropriate classification. The college/unit will cover the cost of the
position including benefits.
C. Reappropriation of Prior Year Balances
For the 1997-98 fiscal year all unspent funds can be carried over to the next fiscal year.
However, every effort should be made to use allocated funds (especially baseline funds)
during the year they were allocated. Requests for funds to be carried over including
one-time funds should be sent to Academic Affairs as one request under a 4599 end of
year (EOY) carryover subcode. Academic Affairs will combine all requests and will
submit one request to the University. Funds requested to be carried over will be
allocated to the college/unit during the first quarter of the next fiscal year. However, if
the college/unit has an unanticipated deficit at the end of the fiscal year, the funds to
cover the deficit will be deducted from the carry over funds before the funds are
transferred. If the college/unit reflects a deficit at the end of the fiscal year and there are
no carry over funds, the amount of the deficit will be deducted from the following year's
budget before baseline allocations are transferred.
D. Transfer of Funds Between Budget Line Items
4
All funds can be transferred between line items in Academic Affairs with the exception
of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the Junior Faculty Support
Development fund.","[-0.013859238475561142, -0.01739075407385826, -0.010359113104641438, 0.0061958483420312405, -0.027310390025377274, -0.0323643833398819, -0.03296081721782684, 0.04432445019483566,

The purpose of an academic department or school is to support the mission of the University by
offering academic programs or courses in the disciplines it houses, promoting academic inquiry
and critical thinking within and across disciplines, and engaging in disciplinary and interdisciplinary
research, scholarship, community service, and creative activities. This policy provides criteria and
guidelines for the establishment of a new department, designation of a unit as a school, and
changing the name of a department or school without changing its structure or designation.
Definitions
1. For the purpose of this policy, the terms ""director"" and ""directors"" shall refer specifically
to the administrative head of a ""school."" The terms do not apply to other ""directors"" of
programs housed within departments/schools (e.g., graduate programs, credential
programs, etc.)

1

Policy Statement
1. To qualify as an academic department or school, the proposed entity must:
a. Intend to offer a set of academic courses, approved through the appropriate FAM
designated curricular process.
b. Ensure to its faculty, the rights and responsibilities of Academic Freedom, as
outlined by FAM 355.6 (Statement Concerning Professional Ethics and
Responsibilities)
c. Provide a plan for a sufficient number of tenure-line faculty, with the assistance of
associated departments when necessary, to provide appropriate curriculum and to
engage meaningfully in shared governance activities.

2. Criteria for the designation of a unit as a school may vary by discipline but should address
issues such as:
a. Professional accreditation or licensing/certification requirements for graduates
b. Established (or emerging) practice for disciplinary terminology in higher education
c. Reorganization of logical subunits within a college, if needed
d. Enhanced potential for procuring grants, contracts or other significant program
funding/resources (e.g. endowments, scholarships, sponsorships).
e. Improvements in services to students, faculty, staff, and
community.
f. How such a designation can contribute to the recruitment
and retention of a high-quality faculty

3. If a department or school wishes to change its name without making structural or
designation changes, it must comply only with item II. Department/School Name Change.
Procedure and Process
Procedures for the Establishment of a New Academic Department or School
1. Initiation of Proposal
a. Faculty members, departments, or administrative officers of the University may
initiate a proposal for a new academic department or school within a college.
Ideally, initiators should collaborate with stakeholders (including related
departments, community members, administrators, etc.) as part of the proposal
process.
b. The initial request should be submitted in writing to the appropriate college
dean(s), who will consult with the Provost or designee, and other
administrators as needed.

2. New Department or School Proposal: The proposal should be organized as follows:
2

a. The exact name of the proposed academic program and name(s) of the
individual(s) preparing the proposal;
b. A list of stakeholders and their statements of support (or other comments).
c. In the case of a ""school"" (not department) proposal, the criteria that provide the
rationale and justification for creating the school (see: purpose and scope).
d. The proposed date of implementation and the appropriate timeline for the
process of implementation;
e. The number of faculty projected in the new department or school's first year of
operation including names of existing faculty, and a statement of how the
proposal might assist with the recruitment and retention of diverse, quality
faculty, including the names of existing faculty who would be moved from other
department(s) and/or school(s).
f. The courses, curricula, programs, degrees to be administered by the new
department or school;
g. Estimation of effects that this change would have on other department(s) or
school(s). If the new department or school is breaking away from existing
academic programs and/or departments, said entities need to be involved in
meaningful consultation.
h. Results of a vote from each department or school directly affected, as well as
written comments from affected academic program chair(s)/director(s) and
faculty should be solicited and appended. Anonymity should be respected
throughout the process including secret ballots and written comments. Voting
should be implemented by the College Elections Officer according to Faculty
Senate elections processes.
i. Any new resources and support needed during each of the first three years of
operation and plan for long-term support. If known, also include a possible
source(s) of funding and a detailed budget of the new department or school.

dean(s) for consultation and signature(s). The college dean(s) shall provide
written comments/ recommendations to the originator(s) of the proposal.
b. After a consultation, the proposal may be revised and resubmitted to the
college dean(s) for further review.
c. The revised proposal along with comments and recommendations from the
college dean(s) will then be forwarded to the Executive Committee (EC) of the
Faculty Senate, which will seek recommendations from the Educational Policy and
3

Resources Committee (EPRC) and, if necessary, recommendations from other
appropriate senate committee
d. The recommendations and comments from the consulting committees will be
submitted to the EC of the Faculty Senate.
e. The EC of Faculty Senate will include the proposal on the Faculty Senate agenda as

g. If the President does not approve the proposal, s/he will return the proposal to
the EC of Faculty Senate with rationale for disapproval, comments, and
recommendations. The EC of Faculty Senate will share this information with the
originators of the proposal.
h. If at any point in the process, where the proposal is not approved, and the
originators wish to pursue the process, they will need to re-submit the proposal
starting from the beginning.
4. Timeline; Timeline reflects an academic year.
5. All efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary delays for each step of the review
process. A recommended timeline from submission to final approval or disapproval is:
a. Dean first review: 3 weeks
b. Revisions (if needed): 2 weeks

35.4,"Purpose and Scope
Pursuant to Article 20, Section 37 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), the CSU
provides resources to each campus for assigned time for exceptional service to students based
on its number of full-time equivalent students. This policy sets forth guidelines for the process
of selecting recipients of this award.

This policy shall remain in effect if the relevant article about the Exceptional Service to Students
Award is retained in a future CBA.
Policy Statement
The Exceptional Service to Students Award (ESSA) is intended to support student mentoring,
advising, and outreach, especially if these activities support underserved, first-generation,
and/or underrepresented students; the development and implementation of high-impact
educational practices; curricular redesign intended to improve student access and success;
service to the department, college, university, or community that goes significantly beyond the
normal expectations of all faculty; assignment to courses where increases to enrollment have
demonstrably increased workload; and other extraordinary forms of service to students.
Priority shall be given to applications that demonstrate that the quality of the students'
educational experience could not have been maintained without an increase in the faculty
member's workload.

Exceptional Service
1. Faculty already receiving assigned time for the same general category of activity (e.g.
assigned time for excess enrollments, assigned time for committee service) shall not be
eligible for support from this pool for the same activities.

spring for use in the following academic year.
3. Any unused funds shall rollover for use in the following academic year.
4. CSUSB shall expend all funds allocated to the campus under this program by the end of
the academic year. The Academic Affairs Office shall provide, by mid-August, the
accounting of expenditures in the previous academic year, including any funds carried
over from prior years, to the Faculty Senate Executive Committee and the Chancellor
Office.
5. Costs of the assigned time shall be calculated based on the minimum salary for an
assistant professor.
6. Awards from appeals shall not exceed one course of the annual pool and shall be funded
in the subsequent academic year.
7. While awards are typically to be given for activities actually conducted during the year
for which the award is granted, work of a similar nature in prior years may be noted in
the narrative and acknowledged as establishing a pattern of exceptional service.

appoint one representative from each academic college and one representative
among the SSPARs, librarians, and coaches to two-year staggered terms. The

35.6,"Preamble: Each year, each CSU campus may submit the names of up to two candidates
for honorary degrees to the Board of Trustees, which makes the final decision on these
awards. Recommendations are to be submitted by the campus President after
consultation “with a committee, including faculty representation, to review
recommendations and to assist in the development and compilation of materials in support
of nominations to be forwarded.”
Procedures:
1. Each Spring term, the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate shall constitute
an Honorary Degree Committee for the following academic year. This committee
will be comprised of:
A. The provost or designee.
B. Five faculty members, one from each college, selected by the Senate
Executive Committee.
C. A member of the library staff, selected by the Senate Executive Committee.
D. A representative of the University Advancement office, nominated by the
President.
2. Early in the Fall term, the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Provost shall invite all
members of the University community and the general public to submit names of
possible recipients of honorary degrees. A deadline of no later than November 1
should be set for these submissions.
3. The VPAA/Provost shall be responsible for assembling the Honorary Degree
Committee, and instructing the committee on its charge, as soon after the
submissions deadline as feasible. Taking into account the systemwide guidelines
for criteria, exclusions, and procedures, the committee shall consider the names
submitted and determine no more than two final nominees. In the process it may
consult with faculty members or others who are specifically familiar with the
accomplishments of certain candidates, or with the fields in which these candidates
have made their mark, as long as complete confidentiality is maintained.
The committee is responsible for compiling material to support the candidates it has
chosen. No later than December 1, the committee should forward its choices,
together with supporting material, to the President. The President may then decide
whether to forward both, one, or neither of the proposed recipients to the Board of
Trustees.","[0.008658950217068195, -0.04305014759302139, -0.028569642454385757, 0.014700646512210369, 0.026588357985019684, -0.009649592451751232, -0.049042925238609314, 0.05836230143904686,

355.6,"Purpose and Scope

FAM 355.6, 2020
Professional Ethics

The purpose of this policy is to maintain ethical standards and define the responsibilities and
accountability as faculty {Unit 3 employees of the University). Ethics in research and creative
activities are addressed in the Policy on Upholding Research Integrity and Responding to the

Allegations of Research Misconduct: https://www.csusb.edu/policies/administration-grants-and-contracts-
support-sponsored-programs-policy

Policy Statement
This policy defines and provides guidance for ethical and accountability for faculty as
colleagues, role models, and teachers, specifically:

l. Professors, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of
knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed upon them. Their primary
responsibility to their subject is to seek and to state the truth as they see it. To this end
professors devote their energies to developing and improving their scholarly competence.
They accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using,
extending and transmitting knowledge.
They practice intellectual honesty. Although professors may follow subsidiary interests,
these interests must never seriously hamper or compromise their academic freedom or
inquiry.
2. As teachers, professors encourage the free pursuit of learning in their students. They hold
before them the best scholarly and ethical standards of their discipline. Professors
demonstrate respect for students as individuals and adhere to their proper roles as
intellectual guides and counselors. Professors make every reasonable effort to foster
honest academic conduct and to assure that their evaluations of students reflect each
student's true merit. They respect the confidential nature of the relationship between
professor and student. They avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory
treatment of students. They acknowledge significant academic or scholarly assistance from
them. They protect their academic freedom.

FAM 355.6, 2020
Professional Ethics

3. As colleagues, professors have obligations that derive from common membership in the
community of scholars. Professors do not discriminate against or harass colleagues. They
respect and defend the free inquiry of associates. In the exchange of criticism and ideas,
professors show due respect for the opinions of others. Professors acknowledge academic
debt and strive to be objective in their professional judgment of colleagues. Professors
accept their share of faculty responsibilities for the governance of their institution. As
members of an academic institution, professors seek above all to be effective teachers and
scholars. Although professors observe the stated regulations of the institution, provided the
regulations do not contravene academic freedom, they maintain their right to criticize and
seek revision. Professors give due regard to their paramount responsibilities within their
institution in determining the amount and character of work done outside it. When
considering the interruption or termination of their service, professors recognize the effect
of their decision upon the program of the institution and give due notice of their intentions.

4. As members of their community, professors have the rights and obligations of other
citizens. Professors measure the urgency of these obligations in the light of their
responsibilities to their subject, to their students, to their profession, and to their
institution. When they speak or act as private persons they avoid creating the impression of
speaking or acting for their college or university. As citizens engaged in a profession that
depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, professors have a particular obligation
to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic
freedom.

5. In accounts of their own professional activities (FARs, AARs, applications for grants and
leaves and the like), faculty members are held to the same standards of honesty as they are
in their professional work itself.

6. Suspected violations of these standards should be called to the attention of the Associate
Provost for Faculty Affairs and Development, who is empowered to conduct an
investigation and take appropriate action. However, observed, suspected, or apparent
misconduct in research and creative activities shall be reported to the Associate Provost for
Research and is subject to the Policy on Upholding Research Integrity and Responding to the
Allegations of Research Misconduct.","[-0.01967521384358406, -0.0012952735414728522, -0.011227406561374664, 0.003597130300477147, 0.02543879672884941, -0.013598242774605751, -0.04520938917994499,

36.4,"1. Purpose and Scope
 The purpose of these grants is to facilitate faculty in their research, scholarship, and
creative activity which will ultimately lead to their professional growth, and to the
enhancement of the student educational experience. Preference will be given to
probationary tenure-track faculty and to proposals not previously funded but which show
evidence of that initial preparation has already taken place. These grants are in the
following categories:
a. Mini-grants (up to $5,000)
 The specific purpose of mini-grants is to provide ""seed monies"" to support new
projects, or new phases of longer term projects that hold promise of extramural
funding. Faculty submitting a mini-grant proposal must indicate the place of their
project in their long-range research program. These grants may be used for support
such as re-assigned time, student assistants, clerical help, duplicating, computer time,
and supplies and services. In addition, mini-grants may be used to fund equipment
and/or travel specifically related to the project.
b. Summer Research Fellowships.
 Summer Research Fellowships are designed to provide faculty with financial
support to start, continue or complete a substantial project of creative activity,
scholarship or research, or an appropriate activity related to the faculty member's
academic discipline. The Fellowship will allow faculty members to apply for either a
stipend or research expenses (eg., supplies, travel, or student support). Examples of
such a project are completion of a manuscript, specialized course work or training, an
exhibition or a performance. Fellowship stipends will be will be fixed annually and may
be supplemented by the Faculty Professional Development Coordinating Committee
(FPDCC), the Associate Provost for Research, or the Provost.
c. Faculty Research Awards
Faculty Research Awards provide reassigned time to develop or complete a
substantial project of creative scholarship or research, or an appropriate activity
related to the faculty member's academic discipline such as completion of a
manuscript, specialized course work or training, an exhibition or a performance.

The department/school in which the faculty resides will receive funding of two-course
reassigned time at the internal rate. Faculty may take their Research Leave during any
academic year quarter, excluding summer sessions; the specific quarter will be decided
upon in consultation with the department chair/school director.
2. Funding
The term “college” shall be used to refer to an academic department/school or
equivalent unit for the purpose of this policy. The two equivalent units shall be (a)
counselors, i.e., SSP, ARs, and (b) librarians.
Total funds available for mini-grants are determined annually in accordance with
allocations from the Chancellor's Office. Chancellor's Office funding for Research,
Scholarship and Creative Activities is allocated to the three grant categories by the
Faculty Professional Development Coordinating Committee (FPDCC). The
available funds for mini-grants are assigned to the colleges based on the following

The Office of Academic Research will distribute the funds to faculty based on
the recommendations of the College Professional Awards Committees and
Deans in accordance with FPDCC allocation guidelines.
3. Eligibility
All tenure-track or tenured faculty members are eligible. Faculty who are in the Faculty
Early Retirement Program (FERP) are not eligible to receive these awards.
4. Application
4.1 Application and proposal description shall be made following the appropriate
standardized format which is available from the Office of Academic Research. Only
one completed application per grant category shall be submitted by an individual

project and elaborate on the following: 1) the reasons for the
applicant undertaking the project; 2) the purpose of the particular
project; 3) if appropriate, the specific research questions or
hypotheses; and 4) the project's relation to the faculty member’s
present or future research or creative activity.
c) Methods: The proposal must clearly describe the activities, including
methods and procedures, which will be conducted and must clearly
show that these are designed to meet the stated objectives.

361.4,"A faculty exchange may be arranged within the CSUC system, with another private or
public institution of higher learning. Faculty exchanges are primarily for faculty who have
been at an institution for an extended period of time and who would, therefore, most
benefit by the renewal which may be gained from an exchange agreement. Exchanges
are made for a period of one academic year.
The following criteria will be applied in evaluating requests for faculty exchange. Only
tenured faculty are eligible for faculty exchange, except in unusual circumstances. The
faculty member's Department Chairman and College Dean must approve the exchange
and certify that the absence of the faculty member will not curtail nor have a negative
effect on the academic program. There must be a tangible demonstration of prospects
for the professional growth of the faculty member or for other benefits for this institution.
In order that there not be too great a disruption to a department's academic program,
normally no more than 20% of the tenured faculty of any department may be on leave at
any one time.
The responsibility lies with the faculty member to initiate the exchange. Thus, a faculty
member bears the burden of finding the exchanging faculty member. A faculty member
should request approval for a proposed exchange in a written memo to his or her
Department Chairman and College Dean, in which the particulars of the exchange are
outlined. The exchanging faculty member coming to this campus must be acceptable to
the gaining department here. Faculty exchanges are normally made by two faculty
members in the same department or discipline. However, an exchange between faculty
or differing disciplines is permissible if appropriate arrangements are made and if no
staffing problems result. A faculty exchange should be arranged sufficiently early in the
academic year to ensure that appropriate curricular and scheduling arrangements can
be made.
Normal faculty appointment procedures, such as the development of a dossier and an
interview, are followed in all faculty exchanges. A written exchange agreement,
developed by the Office of Academic Affairs, will be signed by all faculty involved in the
exchange and by appropriate administrative officers of the institutions. Appropriate
Faculty Benefits, such as accrual of time toward sabbatical leave or an earned merit
salary increase will be specified in the exchange agreement. Arrangements for travel
expenses, if the exchange is within the CSUC system and if the distance between
campuses is greater than 100 miles, may be arranged through the Office of Academic
Affairs. Upon completion of the exchange, the faculty member shall file a report with the
Office of Academic Affairs detailing the experience gained during the exchange.","[-0.046176809817552567, -0.0056149400770664215, -0.01808782108128071, -0.009936871938407421, -0.0025002912152558565,

400.0,"Resolved: Academic freedom is the indispensable quality of institutions of higher
education. As the AAUP's core policy statement argues, ""institutions of higher education
are conducted for the common good and not to further the interest of either the individual
teacher or the institution as a whole. The common good depends upon the free search for
truth and its free exposition"" (1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and
Tenure).
For more than ninety years the AAUP has been engaged in developing standards for
protecting academic freedom and in working for the acceptance of these standards by the
community of higher education. The Association has long been viewed as the authoritative
voice of the academic profession in this regard. Statements, reports, and policies dealing
with academic freedom, as well as with other key issues, are published in the
AAUP's Policy Documents and Reports, also known as the ""Redbook.""","[-0.0291668139398098, -0.029646199196577072, -0.011114170774817467, 0.018872644752264023, -0.005184930749237537,

402.0,"I. Collegiality and Collective Bargaining
On September 13, 1978, Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., signed into law AB 1091,
The California Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA).
(Education Code Section 3560, et. Seq.). This legislation provides faculty members of
the CSUC an opportunity to determine whether they wish to be represented by an
exclusive agent in negotiations on ""wages, hours of employment, and other terms and
conditions of employment"" (HEERA, Section 3561, r.). This section of the Education
Code also specifies the intent of the Legislature to preserve, under collective
bargaining, traditional shared governance mechanisms, including consultation, and the
principle of peer review in faculty personnel decisions. These intentions are expressed
in Section 3561 b. of the HEERA, which reads as follows:
The Legislature recognizes that joint decision-making and consultation between
administration and faculty or academic employees is the long-accepted manner of
governing institutions of higher learning and is essential to the performance of the
educational missions of such institutions, and declares that it is the purpose of this act
to both preserve and encourage that process. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be
construed to restrict, limit or prohibit the full exercise of the functions of the faculty in
any shared governance mechanisms or practices including the Academic Senate of the
University of California and the divisions thereof, the Academic Senates of The
California State University and Colleges, and other faculty councils, with respect to
policies on academic and professional matters affecting The California State University
and Colleges, the University of California, or Hastings College of the Law. The principal
of peer review of appointment, promotion, and retention, and tenure for academic
employees shall be preserved.
This document has been prepared to describe the respective responsibilities of the
Academic Senate of the CSUC and of local Senates or Councils in this collective
bargaining context. The relationships, functions, and responsibilities proposed in this
document reflect consideration of HEERA, the Constitution of the Academic Senate of
The California State University and Colleges and tradition and practice in the CSUC.

The Trustees of the California State Colleges approved the Constitution of the
Academic Senate on March 8, 1963. Prior to this a majority of the voting faculty at each
of a majority of the college campuses had approved the document. Encouragement for
the establishment of the systemwide Academic Senate, as well for the creation of an
Academic Senate on each campus, came from the Chancellor, members of the Board
of Trustees and the California Legislature. The 1961 Legislature adopted Senate
Resolution No. 98 and Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 78 requesting the Trustees
to establish an Academic Senate at each college ""wherein the faculty members shall be
freely elected by their colleagues for the purpose of representing them in the formulation
of policy on academic and professional matters."" Senate Resolution No. 20, which
resolved that the Trustees consider establishing an Academic Senate for the CSUC
system, was under discussion in the Senate Rules Committee when the Senate was
created in 1963.
An examination of the Constitution of the Academic Senate CSUC, as approved by the
Board of Trustees, reveals the official purposes of the Senate:
It shall be the purpose of the Academic Senate of The California State University and
Colleges to serve as the official voice of the faculties of The California State University
and Colleges in matters of systemwide concern; to consider matters concerning
systemwide policies and to make recommendations thereon; to endeavor to strengthen
the Senates and Councils of the several colleges; and to assume such responsibilities
and perform such functions as may be delegated to it by the Chancellor or the Trustees
of The California State University and Colleges.
Senate participation in academic, professional, and administrative matters during the 18
years of its existence evidences a tradition of shared governance in the CSUC and
suggests appropriate responsibilities for the Senate under HEERA. The collective
bargaining act makes explicit provision for the preservation of this tradition and
mandates continuing senate involvement in academic and professional matters. (See
HEERA, Section 3561 b., cited above.)
III. Academic Senate Participation in Systemwide Governance
The Academic Senate shall continue to serve as the official voice of the faculties in
systemwide academic and professional matters (the Constitution of the Academic
Senate CSUC, Article 1, Section 1 a.).
In respect to systemwide governance, the Academic Senate endorses the following
principle:
A. Criteria and standards to be used for the appointment, promotion,
evaluation, and tenure of academic employees shall be the joint
responsibility of the Academic Senate and the Board of Trustees of The
California State University and Colleges (HEERA, Section 3562 r.). (Criteria

FAM 402
Previous FAM 025
3
and standards determined jointly by the Academic Senate CSUC and the
Board of Trustees shall be considered minimal; campus senates/councils
may recommend additional criteria and standards.)
B. The Academic Senate of the California State University and Colleges shall
be consulted on the creation of systemwide and intersegmental committees,
conferences, or task forces designed to deal with educational, professional,
or academically-related fiscal matters, including the charge and composition
of such bodies. The Academic Senate shall be responsible for the selection
of faculty representatives to serve on or participate in such bodies.
C. The Academic Senate of The California State University and Colleges shall
be the formal policy-recommending body on general, systemwide policy
decisions related to the following matters:
1. minimum admission requirements for students;
2. minimum conditions for the award of certificates and degrees to
students;
3. curricula and research programs;
4.
minimum criteria and standards to be used for programs designed
to enhance and maintain professional competence, including the
awarding of academic leaves;
5. systemwide aspects of academic planning.
D. The Academic Senate of The California State University and Colleges shall be
consulted on the following:
1. systemwide aspects of program review;
2. systemwide aspects of the basic direction of academic support
programs;
3. systemwide policies governing the appointment and review of
presidents and academic administrators;
4. policies governing the appointment and review of systemwide
executive officers and academic administrators.
The Academic Senate of The California State University and Colleges shall not
participate in the process of collective bargaining. Normally, matters affecting wages,
hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment shall not be
considered by the Academic Senate. The Academic Senate shall endeavor to ensure
that educational and professional matters do not become subjects of bargaining.
IV. Campus Senate/Council Participation in Governance

The Academic Senate of The California State University and Colleges shall have no
authority over those matters delegated to the individual campuses by the Chancellor or
by the Board of Trustees of The California State University and Colleges. Furthermore,
nothing in this document shall be construed to impair the right of academic senates and
councils of the several campuses to communicate through appropriate channels with
the Chancellor and the Board of Trustees, nor to diminish the authority of the campuses
and their senates in campus matters of academic/professional criteria and standards.
Because joint decision-making and consultation between administrators and faculty is
essential to the performance of the educational missions of The California State
University and Colleges, the academic senates/councils of the campuses shall be the
primary consultative bodies regarding educational and professional matters delegated
to the individual campuses by the Chancellor or by the Board of Trustees of The
California State University and Colleges and shall be consulted on fiscal matters which
affect the instructional program.
In respect to campus governance, the CSUC Academic Senate endorses the following
principles:
A. Responsibility shall be vested in the faculty or its elected senate/council
representatives for:
1. Approval of degree candidates;
2. Development of policies governing the awarding of grades.
B. Through the campus academic senates/councils responsibility shall be
vested in the faculty or its elected senate/council representatives for
developing policies and making recommendations to the campus presidents
on the following matters:
1. criteria and standards for the appointment, retention, awarding of
tenure, promotion and evaluation of academic employees including
preservation of the principle of peer evaluation and provision for
the direct involvement of appropriate faculty in these decisions;
2. determination of membership in the General Faculty;
3. curricular policies, such as admission and degree requirements,
approval of new courses and programs, discontinuance of
academic programs, and academic standards;
4. faculty appointments to institutional task forces, advisory
committees, and auxiliary organizations;
5. academic standards and academic policies governing athletics.

C. The academic senates/councils shall be the primary source of policyrecommendations to the campus president on decisions related to the following
matters:
1. establishment of campus-wide committees on academic or professional matters;
2. the academic role of the library;
3. academic awards, prizes, and scholarships;
4. the academic conduct of students and means for handling infractions;
5. development of institutional missions and goals.
D. The academic senates/councils shall be consulted by the campus presidents
concerning:
1. the academic calendar and policies governing the scheduling of classes;
2. policies governing the appointment and review of academic administrators.
E. This outline of functions and responsibilities is intended to provide the
essentials for a satisfactory system of shared governance but should not
necessarily be viewed as a comprehensive enumeration of such functions
and responsibilities.","[0.014829464256763458, -0.033418092876672745, -0.027927344664931297, 0.027216950431466103, -0.01092969998717308, -0.0033632691483944654, -0.031701307743787766,

voted against the list of eligible voters.
As soon as reasonably possible after the deadline for casting ballots, the Elections Committee/Officer

shall tally the ballots. In the case of university-wide elections, the Chair of the Elections Committee and

If a member of the Elections Committee or an Elections Officer is a candidate for an office covered by

All necessary documentation and/or data, including the checklist of those who voted and the record of
each vote, shall be stored in a secure location for at least ten (10) academic days after the results of
the election are announced. If at the end of ten days the announced results have not been officially
appealed, the materials may be discarded. Otherwise, these must be saved as evidence until the
appeal has been settled by the procedures outlined below (Section J).
The procedure for determining the results of the election shall be as follows:
(1) If the vote is for a single candidate:
(a) If any candidate is the first choice on a majority of ballots, that candidate is declared elected. If
there is no first-choice majority candidate,
(b) the candidate with the smallest number of first choice votes is eliminated, and the ballots on which
that candidate was the first choice are distributed, according to the voters&#39; second choices, among the
candidates remaining. If there is now a majority for one candidate, that person is declared elected.
Otherwise,
(c) the candidate with fewest votes is eliminated and those ballots redistributed according to the voters&#39;
highest remaining choices.
This process is continued until a majority for one candidate is obtained, at which point that candidate is
declared elected.
(d) If it becomes necessary to eliminate a candidate, and there is a tie as to who has the fewest votes,
a random choice procedure will be used to determine which candidate is eliminated prior to the next
count. The same procedure shall be used for any and all ties that may occur when determining the
results.
(2) If the vote is to elect two or more candidates:
One candidate will be elected as in Part (1). Subsequent candidates will be elected as follows:
(a) the ballots will be distributed according to the voters&#39; first choices.
(b) Those ballots whose first-choice votes are for the candidate that has already been elected are
redistributed among the remaining candidates according to the voters&#39; second choices.
If at this stage any candidate has a majority of the votes, he or she is declared elected. If not, the
candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their ballots redistributed according to the voters&#39;
highest remaining choices.
(c) The redistribution process is continued, as in the election of a single candidate, until a majority for

one candidate is obtained, at which point that candidate is declared elected.
(d) Ties are dealt with as in part (a) above.
(e) The process is repeated until the desired number of candidates are elected.
(f) In elections for members of the Faculty Senate, the alternate shall be elected after Senators
are elected.
(3) Invalid Ballots: Ballots shall be invalidated and set aside for any of the following reasons:
(a) failure to authenticate the voter as part of a constituency;
(b) two or more ballots submitted from the same voter;
(c) illegible or indeterminable preferences on ballot.
H. ANNOUNCEMENT OF ELECTION RESULTS
As soon as the ballots have been tallied, the Elections Committee/Officer shall make the results of the
election known to the Faculty.
I. ELECTIONS QUESTIONS
If at any time in the election process any Faculty member(s) have a question about the election
concerning implementation or interpretation of Article II of these bylaws of the Constitution, they shall
put the question in writing to the Elections Committee for decision. The Faculty member(s) may appeal
this decision to the Executive Committee whose rulings shall be final.
J. APPEAL OF ELECTION RESULTS
The announced results of any campus-wide or college/constituent unit election may be appealed within
the first eight (8) academic days after said results are announced. Appeal shall be by petition, signed
by ten (10) faculty members or five (5) in the case of college/constituent unit elections, and delivered to
the Elections Committee/Officer or the Senate support staff as appropriate. The appeal shall state the
grounds for questioning the announced election results.
The merits of any appeal for university-wide or college/constituent unit elections shall be judged as

ARTICLE III - RESIGNATIONS AND RECALL ELECTIONS
Section 1
Any Faculty Senator, State-wide Academic Senator or Faculty Senate committee member
who is going on full-time leave for more than one academic term shall vacate their position
at the beginning of the academic year in which the leave will occur. Should the notice of leave
occur during the operative year, then they should vacate the position immediately. When the
office is ordinarily filled by an election or appointment, a new election shall be held or an
appointment made, respectively, to fill the unexpired term of office.
Section 2
Any Faculty Senator, State-wide Academic Senator or Faculty Senate committee member
who cannot fulfill their membership responsibilities, especially with regard to attendance to
meetings, must resign so that the affected constituency may be properly represented. New
elections shall be held or appointments made to fill the unexpired term of office. If an elected
body loses a faculty member and has ten weeks or less of business remaining for that
academic year, then the Executive Committee shall appoint a replacement.
Section 3
If a Faculty Senator or State-wide Academic Senator fails to resign or reassume their
responsibilities under suggestion by the Senate Chair, the Senate, by majority vote, may refer
the matter to the Elections Committee. The Elections Committee shall have ten (10) academic
days after receiving the complaint to investigate and seek a mutually satisfactory solution to
the complaint. If none is found, the Committee will issue a report, with copies to the Senate
and the Senator under investigation. If the Elections Committee&#39;s findings uphold the Senate&#39;s
complaint, it shall then immediately initiate a recall election. The recall ballot shall include a
summary of the findings of the Elections Committee and will include a statement in rebuttal
from the Senator subject to recall if they so desire.
Section 4
If a committee member fails to resign or reassume their responsibilities under suggestion by
the committee chair, the committee, by majority vote, may refer the matter to the Elections
Committee. The Elections Committee shall have ten (10) academic days after receiving the
committee complaint to investigate and seek a mutually satisfactory solution to the complaint.
If none is found, the Committee will issue a report, with copies to the Senate, committee chair,
and the committee member under investigation. If the Elections Committee&#39;s findings uphold
the committee&#39;s complaint, it shall then immediately initiate a recall election. The recall ballot
shall include a summary of the findings of the Elections Committee and will include a
statement in rebuttal from the committee member subject to recall if they desire. The
electorate for Executive Committee appointments shall be the Executive Committee. The

One senate position shall be allocated to each of these units, and the number of
additional senate positions for each unit shall be determined by the following formula: the
number of faculty in that unit times 25 divided by the total number of faculty in all seven
units. The numbers used in the formula shall include only tenure-line faculty for each of
the five colleges and shall include both tenure-line faculty and qualified lecturers, as
defined in Article I, Section 1, Subsection A, for the Library and Student Services
Professionals - Academic Related. If the decimal part of the number resulting from this
formula is greater than or equal to 0.5, the number shall be raised to the next highest
integer, otherwise the decimal part shall be dropped.

The senators for each unit shall be elected by and from the faculty of that unit. For the
five colleges, only tenure-line faculty are eligible to vote for and serve in these positions.
For the librarians and student services professionals - academic related, both tenure-line
faculty and qualified lecturers, as defined in Article I, Section 1, Subsection A, are eligible
to vote for and serve in these positions.
This formula shall be implemented during the fall semester prior to electing Faculty
Senators in the Spring. The Faculty Senators so elected shall serve their entire terms
regardless of any change in number of faculty in any of the units during the course of the
academic year. If any unit is scheduled to gain or lose more than one senate seat in a
given academic year, it shall gain or lose only one seat per year until compliance with this
formula is achieved.
B. One lecturer representative from each of the five colleges shall be elected during
the regular Spring election cycle by and from qualified lecturers, as defined in
Article I Section 1, Subsection A, in that college.
